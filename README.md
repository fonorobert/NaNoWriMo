#To the East, But Not Too Far

Welcome. This is the repository of my novel-in-progress: To the East, But Not Too Far (the title, as everything in the novel, is subject to change).

By writing this novel I am participating in [NaNoWriMo 2014.](http://nanowrimo.org/about)

You can **[browse the chapters](chapters)** I've already written, submit issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/fonorobert/NaNoWriMo/issues) to ask questions or you can even [sumbit pull requests](https://github.com/fonorobert/NaNoWriMo/pulls) to contribute to the novel.

*I will create a `Contribution` section later on where I will tell you all about how to contribute to my novel*
