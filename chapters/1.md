The fields were vast and showed no desire to ever end. They were mostly brown and yellow, with some patches of green mixed in, just for variety.
Through the fields ran an old dirt road. It was a regular road once, connecting villages with towns and farms with the rest of society, but that was a long time ago. Nowadays it was just a dirt road and only a few pieces of asphalt stayed to remind travellers of good times gone by.
It was quiet in the fields. Peacfully, sadly quiet.
Peter saw nothing of the bald autumn land. He didn't see the two trees waving their branches to the lazy wind, or the old road, or the yellow fields. His vision was foggy and his head throbbing. He saw little in fact that he couldn't even see the inside of the worn-down white Ford Transit he was racing across the landscape in, leaving a large cloud of dust behind. But then it was very dark inside the van, so maybe he couldn't have seen anything if his vision was all right.
He felt the car bump on a piece of asphalt left embedded in the dirt road and slipped back into his heavy, unusually heavy sleep.

He woke to the feeling of a cool breeze on his face. He tried to open his eyes, but they wouldn't oblige. He heard strange voices in the distance, but he didn't understand what they were saying.
